# Antivirus
Objective - To detect and remove malware from a computer system.

Problem Statement - "Develop a Python-based antivirus program that is capable of detecting and removing common types of malware from a user's computer, while minimizing false positives and minimizing the impact on system performance."
A simple antivirus coded in python capable of scanning selected files and deleting files that it detects as infected. This antivirus uses a large list of MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 malware hashes to determine infections.

Modules used - 
1.The filename module in python is used to work with file and directory names. It provides functions to manipulate file paths and check their properties.

2.The QtCore, QtGui, and QtWidgets modules are a part of the PyQt5 library and are used to create GUI applications in python. QtCore provides non-GUI functionality, such as signals and slots, while QtGui provides widgets and layouts for creating a GUI. QtWidgets is a module that contains all the GUI classes for creating a desktop application.

3.The Virustotal module is a python wrapper for the VirusTotal API, which is a service that analyzes files and URLs for malware and other threats. This module allows developers to access the VirusTotal API and perform actions such as file scanning and URL checking.

4.The configparser module is used to read and write configuration files in python. It provides methods to access and modify the data in the configuration files.

5.The webbrowser module is a built-in module in python that allows developers to open a web page in the default browser. It provides a simple interface for opening URLs and controlling the browser.

6.The requests module is a popular library for making HTTP requests in python. It allows developers to send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests and handle the response from the server.

7.The hashlib module is used to create hash values for data in python. It provides a variety of hash algorithms such as SHA-256, MD5, and SHA-1.

8.The sys module is a built-in module in python that provides access to system-specific parameters and functions. It allows developers to work with command-line arguments, exit codes, and other system-level functionality.

9.The os module is a built-in module in python that provides a way to interact with the operating system. It allows developers to perform actions such as creating and deleting files and directories, changing permissions, and interacting with the environmentÂ variables.
